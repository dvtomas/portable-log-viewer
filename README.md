# Slog Logs viewer

Single-page webapp for user-friendly viewing and filtering logs 
in the [slog](https://crates.io/crates/slog) format.
Written in the [Elm programming language](https://elm-lang.org/).

The slog log lines look like this:

`Aug 04 12:58:20.509 INFO Connecting to simulated camera device, device: CAM01, DeviceManager: CAM01, module: KmsCompoundDevices`

Could probably be easily modified to support other formats.
